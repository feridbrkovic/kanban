# Kanban

This is a simple kanban board application. It is built using Angular and Angular Material. The application allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. The tasks are organized into four columns: Ideas, Todo, In Progress, and Done. The tasks can be moved between the columns by dragging and dropping them. The application uses local storage to persist the tasks.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
